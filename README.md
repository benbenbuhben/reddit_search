## Description  
* This is a ReactJS app that allows the user to see a list of recent posts from their favorite subreddits.
* Some of my favorite subreddits to try out: `explainlikeimfive`, `changemyview`, and `askscience`
* Some of my favorite numbers to choose in the `# of Results` field: `4`, `11`, and `23`
* If you'd like to donate, just give all your money to Ben in person, because he hasn't figured out how to link in PayPal yet.
